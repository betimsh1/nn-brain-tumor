Title: Neural Network Project README

This project, conducted for ECE 5268 â€“ Theory of Neural Networks, focuses on classifying MRI brain images into four tumor categories: no tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary. Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras, the neural network architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification with a softmax activation function in the output layer.
